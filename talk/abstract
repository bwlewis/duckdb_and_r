DuckDB (https://duckdb.org) is a new embedded SQL database library in the
spirit of other embedded databases like SQLite. Unlike SQLite, DuckDB uses a
column-oriented data layout (like R data frames) and has a particular focus on
performance for interactive data analysis.  DuckDB's integration with R is so
complete that it can work directly on in-memory language objects without
copying. This lets you use DuckDB directly on R data frames, including
excellent support for dplyr.

I'll show some practical examples of R and DuckDB and share my thoughts how to
best use these technologies together.
