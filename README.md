# My thoughts on DuckDB and R with examples

This is work in progress as of May 2021, not all examples are complete and
things are changing. I organize my thoughts into five easy pieces below.

* [Overview](https://bwlewis.github.io/duckdb_and_r/thoughts_on_duckdb.html)

The easy pieces:

* [TPCH join-aggregate example from DuckDB](https://bwlewis.github.io/duckdb_and_r/tpch/tpch.html)
* [Last item per group](https://bwlewis.github.io/duckdb_and_r/last/last.html)
* [Genomic overlap joins](https://bwlewis.github.io/duckdb_and_r/ranges/ranges.html)
* [Large out of core data]()
* ["As of"-style joins]()

A "don't use SQL" rant born out of frustration while compiling these notes appears here:

[Declarative, Schmerative](https://bwlewis.github.io/duckdb_and_r/last/declarative.html)
